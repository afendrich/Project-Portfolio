# README

This is my first attempt at a responsive website for Project 1.

## Notes & To-Do List:
1. This is my first attempt at using Github to host a website.  
2. I need to incorporate responsive images into my design.  
3. In the "Featured Work" section, I need to get the flexbox formatting right when viewing on the largest screens.  Currently the images do not line up, and its not athestically pleasing.  
4. References to image owners is needed.
